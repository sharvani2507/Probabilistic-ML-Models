# Notebooks â€“ Probabilistic Modeling in Practice

This folder contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that document my **learning-by-doing** approach to Probabilistic Machine Learning.

The implementations here are not always polished or final â€“ they are part of an iterative process of understanding, debugging, and experimenting with core concepts like:
- Bayesian linear/logistic regression
- Variational inference
- Latent variable models (e.g., Gaussian Mixtures)
- Uncertainty quantification

---

## Contents

Each notebook is self-contained and includes:
- A specific probabilistic model
- Commentary on theoretical intuition (as I understood it)
- Step-by-step implementation using [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/) and PyTorch
- Diagnostics and visualizations (when applicable)

## Notes

- These notebooks are part of my internship and reflect an ongoing learning journey.
- I'm prioritizing clarity and conceptual understanding over code perfection.
- Feedback and discussions are welcome!
