# Probabilistic Machine Learning Models

This repository contains my ongoing learning and implementations in **Probabilistic Machine Learning (PML)**, developed during my research internship. The focus is on building models from scratch using tools like [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and developing an intuition for inference, uncertainty, and latent variable modeling.

---

## Goals

- Build foundational probabilistic models
- Learn both Bayesian and variational inference techniques
- Explore applications on real datasets
- Understand and visualize uncertainty
- Maintain reproducible research practices

---

## Models Implemented

- âœ… Bayesian Linear Regression  
- ðŸ”„ Bayesian Logistic Regression  
- ðŸ”„ Latent Gaussian Models (with SVI)  
- ðŸ”„ Gaussian Mixture Models  
- ðŸ”„ More to come...

Each model lives in a self-contained notebook under the `notebooks/` directory.

---

## Requirements

- Python â‰¥ 3.8  
- `torch`, `pyro-ppl`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`

---

## Running the Notebooks

All experiments are written in Jupyter notebooks.
You can launch them using:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

---

## Notes

- This repo is for learning and experimentation.
- I update it weekly with new models and improvements.
- Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
